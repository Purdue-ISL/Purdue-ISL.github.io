The project is investigating to deliver high quality video across diverse and variable network conditions. Most Internet video delivery uses adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms, combined with HTTP chunk-based streaming protocols, and ABR algorithm is one of the critical part for success of high QoE Internet video delivery. However, these ABR algorithms today have fixed and closed source implementations which results in two problems: 1) content publishers can't customize them according to their preference 2) no single algorithm works well across the diverse range of bandwidth conditions in the wild. In order to solve these problems we propose a novel video delivery pipeline.

The project is investigating systematic frameworks to help operators redesign their networks to meet desired high-level objectives. Optimization problems are formulated that trade-off the benefits of a redesign task with the reconfiguration costs involved. Algorithms for the redesign tasks are derived by exploring synergies with theoretical work in the operations research community. We are devising ways to map high-level network design to low-level configuration complexity metrics, and investigating algorithms to minimize the complexity of network designs. The techniques are being applied to important and unexplored problem domains such as migrating security policies from enterprise data centers to a cloud computing model, reorganizing routing designs on mergers, and service differentiation policies. The research if successful will change how operators manage their networks, leading to large cost-savings for IT organizations, and the creation of more reliable and secure networks.

Web download is one of the key activities contributing to a significant fraction of the mobile traffic than any other application, excluding video streaming. Mobile Web experience is still not par with desktops, particularly the page load times are in the order of a few seconds. This is because modern Web pages are complex and feature-rich customized for individual user preferences, with lots of objects fetched (as a result of parsing HTML and/or executing Javascripts) from many domains. Consequently, this results in lots of HTTP request-response interactions in the high latency cellular link. Thus, today's web page download process is ill suited to cellular networks resulting in high page load times. To tackle this challenge, we are developing systems and techniques to improve Mobile Web performance by optimizing the last-mile network delays that dominate page load latencies in cellular settings. Specifically, (1) a proxy based system design that judiciously refactors browsing functionality between a proxy (inside the cellular network) and a client based on their respective strengths (figure below) (2) develop techniques to make the proxy design scale to millions of users by reducing its computational overhead.

Today's Web pages consist of hundreds of objects with complex dependencies, with some objects being more critical to page-load latencies than others (e.g., javascripts may determine which objects are needed). Yet, current Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are agnostic to object criticality, potentially impacting overall page latencies. We seek to achieve low latency for several tens of thousands of the most popular pages by exploring novel criticality-aware algorithms for object placement and caching.`,"to-page":"https://engineering.purdue.edu/~isl/MobileWeb.html"}),e(t,{title:"Abstractions for Enterprise Network Management",content:`The use of abstractions to simplify network design and configuration has been a long cherished vision in the networking community. We posit that achieving more fundamental break-throughs requires abstractions that go beyond merely modeling the underlying protocols and mechanisms.

        Our focus is on the management of enterprise networks.  Despite their critical importance, and their striking differences and diversity compared to carrier networks, enterprise networks have been largely unexplored by networking researchers. We envision a three-pronged research process that involves:
          (i) capturing the goals operators have for their networks, through interactions with operators, and bottom-up studies of actual network designs, (ii) elevating the design patterns we observe into abstractions; and (iii) demonstrating that abstractions can simplify both top-down network design, and validation of network properties.
          A distinguishing feature of this research is its white-box methodology to studying network designs. Rather than infer network characteristics with limited support from network operators as is common practice today, we will capitalize on our extensive ties with real network operators, and conduct studies using data such as router configuration files obtained with their support, and iterative interactions with them.
